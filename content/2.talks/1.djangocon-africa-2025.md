## About the Talk

In this talk, I shared my journey with accessibility advocacy through the [Djangonaut Space Program](https://djangonaut.space/), where I contributed to improving accessibility in the Django framework.

I covered practical approaches to building inclusive web applications, including semantic HTML best practices, screen reader testing techniques, and how to integrate accessibility considerations into the development workflow from the ground up.
